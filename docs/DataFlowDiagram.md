# Data Flow Diagram (DFD)

This document provides a Data Flow Diagram for the MSM project.

## Overview

A Data Flow Diagram visually represents how data moves through the system, including processes, data stores, external entities, and data flows.

## Level 0 DFD (Context Diagram)

```plantuml
@startuml Level0DFD
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor transparent
skinparam roundCorner 15

' Define external entities
card "User" as user
card "Administrator" as admin
card "External API" as ext_api

' Define the main system
rectangle "MSM System" as system

' Define the data flows
user --> system : User Input/Requests
system --> user : Responses/Data
admin --> system : Configuration/Management
system --> admin : Status/Reports
ext_api <--> system : Data Exchange

## Level 1 DFD

```plantuml
@startuml Level1DFD
!theme plain
skinparam backgroundColor transparent
skinparam roundCorner 15

' External entities
card "User" as user
card "Administrator" as admin
card "External API" as ext_api

' Processes
circle "Authentication\nProcess" as auth
circle "Data\nProcessing" as process
circle "Reporting\nSystem" as report

' Data stores
database "User Database" as user_db
database "Application Data" as app_db
database "Logs" as logs

' Data flows
user --> auth : Login Credentials
auth --> user : Authentication Result
auth <--> user_db : Verify Credentials
user --> process : Submit Data
process --> user : Processed Results
process <--> app_db : Store/Retrieve Data
admin --> process : Admin Commands
process --> admin : Status Information
admin --> report : Report Requests
report --> admin : Generated Reports
report <--> app_db : Query Data
ext_api <--> process : API Data Exchange
process --> logs : Log Events

```

## How to Use

1. Install PlantUML (https://plantuml.com/starting)
2. Use a PlantUML compatible editor or plugin (VS Code has plugins)
3. Generate the diagrams from the code blocks above
4. Customize the diagrams to match your specific project architecture

## Customizing the DFD

To customize this DFD for your specific project:

1. Identify all external entities (users, systems that interact with yours)
2. List all processes in your application
3. Document all data stores (databases, files)
4. Map the data flows between entities, processes, and data stores
5. Update the PlantUML code accordingly

## Notes

- Level 0 provides a high-level context view
- Level 1 breaks down the main processes and data flows
- Additional levels can be created to show more detail for complex subsystems
```

## Maintaining the DFD

Update this diagram when making significant architectural changes to ensure documentation remains accurate.
